##How to Run

When you start this program, you'll be greeted with a user-friendly menu, to help guide you though all of your options. Because your menu is in a while loop, feel free to revisit any of your options. Especially option 7, you'll want to do that one a few times. When you've had your fun, option 10 will release you from the program.
